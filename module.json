You can fit one aeon stone into this item's aeon lattice with a single Interact action. Placing an aeon stone in this socket provides you all the benefits of the aeon stone as if it were orbiting your head, but protects the stone from being noticed or stolen easily. You invest a Resonating item and the aeon stone within it simultaneously, and they count as only one item toward your investiture limit. An invested aeon stone slotted in a Resonating item also grants its resonant power, and, unlike aeon stones resonating within a wayfinder, these resonating aeon stones grant growing power as you combine multiple resonating items containing socketed aeon stones, without interfering with one another. As you invest multiple Resonating items with socketed aeon stones, each Resonating item gains additional effects, as listed within the item."
