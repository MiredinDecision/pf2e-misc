      "value": "<p>Acavna, the Shield, was one of humanity's fiercest protectors. Legends of her tactics and exploits spanned the entirety of the Azlanti Empire. Her most famous act of heroism led to her death during the events of Earthfall. Determined to protect her people, Acavna refused to stand down despite her partner Amaznen's pleas. She used her magic to move Golarion's moon in the way of the incoming meteor, absorbing most of the destructive blast. Her body fell from the sky and plunged into the planet's core. The Mordant Spire grew from her remains, and the elves who reside there claim to hear Acavna whispering to them.</p><p><strong>Title</strong> The Shield</p><p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> Companionship, defensive tactics, the moon</p><p><strong>Edicts</strong> Protect the weak and innocent, use defense as your first resource, make choices for the good of all and not the good of one</p><p><strong>Anathema</strong> Attack without cause, ignore the pleas of the weak and innocent, act solely for your own self interest</p><p><strong>Religious Symbol</strong> crossed spears over a full moon</p><p><strong>Sacred Animal</strong> rabbit</p><p><strong>Sacred Colors</strong> periwinkle</p><p></p><p>The shining sun of Sarenrae, the twinkling stars of Desna, and the shimmering rainbow of Shelyn come together to form the Radiant Prism, a relatively small pantheon worshipped by those who actively fight against evil to protect the innocent. These three goddesses have been romantically involved with one another from time to time, so it makes sense that they would form a coalition. In addition to defeating the wicked, the Radiant Prism promotes the creation of beautiful works of art to bring more grace to the world.</p><p><strong>Pantheon Members</strong> Desna, Sarenrae, Shelyn</p><p><strong>Edicts</strong> create works that inspire good acts, defend those who cannot defend themselves, pursue evil</p><p><strong>Anathema</strong> allow evil to spread, destroy that which brings joy to others, fail to offer evil a chance to surrender</p><p><strong>Religious Symbol</strong> rainbow arcing between the sun and a twinkling star</p>"
