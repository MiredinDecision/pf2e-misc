      "value": "<p>Through a delicate and intricate 1-hour ritual, you can bestow one ally you trust with power over one of your Regalia. Choose one of your Bound Regalia, and one willing ally. When you Call your Armiger, you can no longer use your chosen regalia. Instead, as long as that ally remains within 30ft of you, they can Strike using this inherited Regalia. This ally also gains access to a single 1st- or 2nd-level Discipline Feat that you have, and is able to perform that action using their inherited Regalia. The inherited Regalia gains the Broken condition when used as usual Requiring you to use Call Armiger to replenish it.</p><p>If you Unbind the inherited Regalia, you must use the Rite of Inheritance activity again in order to assign a new Regalia as the Inherited Regalia. You can only have one ally benefiting from Rite of Inheritance at a time.</p>",
