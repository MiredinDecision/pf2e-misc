Make a Strike using your Regalia. If that attack hits, you can then lend one regalia of your choice to an ally within 15ft of you. That ally can then Stride up to Half its Speed and Strike using the lent Regalia as a Reaction. They utilize the highest of their Strength, Dexteriy or Wistom modifiers when resolving this Strike, regardless of the Traits of the weapon. Additionally, their proficiency with the weapon matches yours, unless the ally's proficiency is higher.</p><p class=\"hang\"><strong>Special</strong> You can use more than one action when using Link Strike. For each Action used, you can lend one additional Regalia to one additional Ally, to a maximum of 3 Allies. Each Ally can only make a single strike as part of Link Strike.</p>",
