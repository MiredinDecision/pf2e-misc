The target must succeed at a @Check[fortitude|against:class-spell] save against the higher of your class or spell DC or become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.4D2KBtexWXa6oUMR]{Drained 1}. Regardless of the outcome of this save, the target is temporarily immune to your Taste Blood for 1 day; further uses of this ability against the target don't increase the drained condition or grant you more temporary Hit Points.</p><p>To drink a creature's blood, either your last action must have been a fangs Strike that damaged the target, or the target must be @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.VcDeM8A5oI6VqhbM]{Restrained} or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.fBnFDH2MTzgFijKf]{Unconscious} and your last action must have been a Strike that dealt piercing or slashing damage to them.
